<a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/08/22/tumblr-becomes-next-property-instagram-twitter-friend-finding-privileges-revoked/">Tumblr and Twitter aren't friends any more</a><br/><p>From TheNextWeb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enormous blogging platform Tumblr appears to have become the next property after Instagram to have its friend-finding privileges revoked. The option to find people that you know using Twitter has been removed from the site after its axing was predicted by Matt Buchanan in an article on Buzzfeed earlier today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even more concerning, especially as Tumblr was working with Twitter as a developer for their ‘Cards’ product as reported by <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/22/twitter-cuts-off-tumblr-friend-finding">Marco Arment here</a>.</p>
