<p>For me, confidence is about being able to <strong>know I can do something</strong>. I think about it a lot.<br/><br/>I can find my confidence gets knocked very easily sometimes. I give myself a hard time if I&rsquo;m not perfect instantly. <br/><br/>However, it&rsquo;s not really surprising that this happens. If, like me, you work in a job where a large part of it it is doing new things, how do do you get to practise regularly? <br/><br/>If practise makes perfect, how do you get confident?<br/><br/>For me, I think it&rsquo;s about being able to make the most of every opportunity to practise as you go. <strong>To not be fly-by-night</strong>, but to know when you&rsquo;re operating around lots of change it&rsquo;s a chance to practise on many different fronts.<br/><br/>If what you&rsquo;re doing is new then it can be tempting to look for 30-hundred examples of vaguely relevant past experience. It can feel like you&rsquo;re assembling a bit of a salad of expertise, borrowing from lots of different past experiences.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s OK. You almost certainly need to establish your experience a lot less than you realise.<br/><br/>I think that being able to manage and develop your confidence is one of the most important skills when you&rsquo;re doing &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; work.</p>
