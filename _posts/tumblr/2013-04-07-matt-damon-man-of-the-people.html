<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/apr/07/matt-damon-interview">Matt Damon: man of the people</a><br/><p>Interesting little feature in The Observer on Matt Damon:</p>

<blockquote>The family have a two-week rule, where they will not be apart for any longer. Damon is completely unyielding on it: when he shot Invictus, he flew out Alexia’s entire school class to South Africa and organised for them to do a special project on Nelson Mandela. Damon’s advice on living in a household of five women is simple: “Find yourself a little man area.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The values that I have are the values I was raised with, from where I’m from, which is a middle-class place,” Damon says. “So that informs everything about me, my politics and all that stuff. I mean, politically I vote against my own self-interest at every election. I actively ask these people to raise my taxes. But I believe a solid, really strong middle-class is the key to making the country in the best way.”</blockquote>
