<p>A piece on the delicious animated BFG film from the Guardian today:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>David Jason voiced the giant. I first found him when I was doing voice tests for Danger Mouse. With a lot of voice actors, all you get is them; David has the ability to stop being David Jason. He doesn&rsquo;t dodge the emotional stuff, either: at the end, there is a scene where he says he has to go back to giant land. Sophie says she wants to go with him. The BFG says: &ldquo;Do you really?&rdquo; And she says: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s very touching, despite being essentially a couple of drawings talking to each other.</blockquote><br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve not watched it, you need to.<br/><br/>
