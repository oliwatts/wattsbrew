<p>I&rsquo;m conducting an experiment.</p>

<p>For the past 5 years I&rsquo;ve always had some form of smartphone. That&rsquo;s 5 years of constant connection to the whole of the Internet. 5 years where I&rsquo;ve never really had a blank, empty moment. 5 years of a constant inward flow of information.</p>

<p>This got me thinking: What else could I have done with that time? Often its only a few minutes here and there, but it certainly adds up.</p>

<p>Now, this does not mean it&rsquo;s been wasted time. I&rsquo;ve made some real and valuable friendships and learnt some useful things by being constantly connected.</p>

<p>Having access to things like Twitter and Facebook in my pocket has created a pavlovian reaction when I&rsquo;m bored or not immediately occupied - an easy way to get a &lsquo;social&rsquo; hit. I&rsquo;m not as bad as some. I know people who conduct entire conversations they&rsquo;re sat next to whilst 'checking in&rsquo; or Tweeting.</p>

<p>So, my experiment: see if I can break that pocket pavlovian reaction. See if I can use a smartphone as a tool, not a thing to grout the cracks in my day to day activities.</p>
