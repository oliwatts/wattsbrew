<p>Speaking of <a title="The Good Internet" href="http://obilog.co.uk/p/the-good-internet/">crowdsourced funding</a> my brother Harry is launching a new photography project, and he&rsquo;s looking for donations.</p><blockquote>The original issue of FINDS was distributed guerilla-style during the Brighton Fringe Festival 2010 and around various locations in London, creating a social frenzy to &lsquo;find&rsquo; FINDS.</blockquote>FINDS was a great project, leaving newspapers at random places containing rather cool photos of found and discarded material. FINDS 2 will do the same across Brighton and London.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/159802/pledges/new?perk_amt=20&amp;perk_id=430891">£10</a> will get you a copy of both the original FINDS and the new project, and <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/159802/pledges/new?perk_amt=60&amp;perk_id=430903">£60</a> will get you copies of all of Harry&rsquo;s work.<br/><br/>Harry is a brilliant photographer, regularly shoots for the Telegraph, has worked with Salvatore Ferragamo and photographers Martin Parr and Ewen Spencer.<br/><br/>In addition to being a brilliant photographer, he&rsquo;s also one of the finest men on the planet.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/finds2?buffer_share=c5d8c">Fund now!</a>
