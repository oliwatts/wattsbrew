<p>Mr Ben Locker: [1. Who is an <a href="http://www.benlocker.co.uk/">outstanding copyrighter</a> and fine beer drinker.]</p><blockquote>Instead of wasting my time trying to cultivate the kind of creative imagination I couldn’t achieve and didn’t want, I switched my attention to the nuts and bolts of writing — the words, and the ways you can put them together.</blockquote>I think I&rsquo;ve read, and re-read, Ben&rsquo;s post at least 5 times. Every time I read it, I love it a little bit more.<br/><br/>I made a decision to start blogging regularly this year because I enjoy the act of writing.<br/><br/>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter about the topic; it&rsquo;s about luxuriating in the act of putting the right words in the right order to end up with something that feels crafted.
