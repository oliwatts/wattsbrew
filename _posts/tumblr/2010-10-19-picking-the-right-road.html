<p>This post from Seth Godin inspired me (my emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p style="padding-left:30px;">Four roads</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">You might be stuck because you pick the wrong fork on a looping road. You keep getting better at the route you cover, but it doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere, you just keep doing it over and over. Nine years of experience is very different from one year of experience, nine times.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">You might be impatient or unable to stick to your decision to take this particular road, and thus you&rsquo;re always starting on a new road. Since the new road is always strange to you, you rarely get any better at getting where you&rsquo;re going.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>You might be on the wrong road. Sure, you get better at navigating your way, you can walk faster, you feel more comfortable&ndash;but this road is never going to lead much of anywhere.</em></p><p style="padding-left:30px;">And, if you&rsquo;re lucky, you might be on the right road, and getting better as you go.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this sort of thing recently, and it fits nicely with my new driver status.</p><p>To extend the analogy, I&rsquo;ve experienced lots of different roads over the last 10 years. Often I&rsquo;ve switched because I&rsquo;ve been tempted away; moving from a country lane to a bustling motorway.</p><p>The changes that have been the most valuable are the ones that I&rsquo;ve taken without a clear view of what the next road will look like; prompted by a real feeling that the potholes or curious direction of the current one make it the wrong place to be.</p><p>I think a road is a good analogy for how many jobs feel. Good ones should have a clear starting point and, if not an end point, then a collection of exciting landmarks or interesting places to stop by and refresh yourself.</p><p>I am looking forward to getting rolling on a new road soon. Taking the time out to pick the right one has been the best decision.</p><p> </p>
