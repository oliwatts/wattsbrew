<blockquote><h2><strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/20/bbc-targets-social-media-users-with-instagram-video-news">BBC targets social media users with Instagram video news</a></strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>BBC News is stepping up its efforts to reach new audiences on social media platforms after mobile and tablet viewing figures overtook desktop use for the first time in December.</p>
<p>On 16 January, BBC News launched Instafax, a new short-form video news service delivered to Instagram users. The project is a month-long experiment, with three 15-second videos uploaded a day, intended to serve as a roundup of the day’s news.</p>
<p>The name is a throwback to the BBC’s former Ceefax service – the world’s first teletext service that ran on UK television until 2012. This is described as the updated version of a text-based, short-form news service for the digital age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bit that’s missing from all of these stories is probably its most brilliant:</p>
<p>For 38 years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceefax">the BBC ran an information service called Ceefax</a> which delivered the news in short four-sentence blurbs.</p>
<p>In order to create news copy for Ceefax, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">every BBC News staffer was required to file their stories in a way</a> where the entire story could be understood in the first four lines.</p>
<p>Although the Ceefax service shut down in 2012, staffers never stopped writing using the four sentence summary format.</p>
<p>That’s when <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdanzico">Matt Danzico</a> realized that he could just grab the first four lines of a story, pair it with already cleared footage + images to create posts for Instagram, and Bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p>Seeing as this text is actually marked up (view source on any BBC News article and search for <em>&lt;p class=”introduction&quot; id=”story_continues_1&quot;&gt;</em>) scripting this process would be the next interesting step to take.</p></blockquote>
