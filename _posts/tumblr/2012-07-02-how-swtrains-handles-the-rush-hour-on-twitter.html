<p>From BBC News:</p><blockquote>At 15:33, she [Allison Dunn, SW&rsquo;s Social Media Head] tweeted on the officialÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SW_trains">South West Trains Twitter account</a>: &ldquo;All lines through Wimbledon station currently blocked owing to emergency services dealing with an incident at Wimbledon. More to follow.&rdquo;<br/><br/>There was a lot more to follow . By the end of the evening more than 150 tweets had been sent out - double the usual number.</blockquote><br/><br/>Great article about how a train operator uses existing customer service processes to communicate through Twitter, and some of the governance issues they&rsquo;ve faced internally.
