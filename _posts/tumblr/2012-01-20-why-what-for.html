<p>If you spend any time working with, in or around &lsquo;social media&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll eventually come to have two favourite questions:<br/><br/></p><ol><li>Why?</li>	<li>What for?</li></ol><br/><br/>Want a 'Facebook Page?&rsquo; - <strong>Why?</strong>Need more Twitter followers? - <strong>What for?</strong>After a 'social media strategy?&rsquo; - <strong>Why?</strong><br/><br/>If there&rsquo;s not a really good answer 'Why?&rsquo; or 'What for?&rsquo; then don&rsquo;t bother. Trust me. Spend your time on a part of your business you can answer those questions for. You&rsquo;re probably too busy anyway.<br/><br/><strong>Want to work out 'Why?&rsquo; or 'What for?&rsquo;</strong><br/><br/>Think about what parts of your business could benefit from better connection to customers, clients, service users or thought leaders.<br/><br/>Think about how you could remove the fourth wall between the people inside your business and the people outside your business.<br/><br/>Think about how you could sell more by knowing your customers better, and getting your customers to know you better.<br/><br/>Most times you don&rsquo;t need Facebook and you don&rsquo;t need Twitter.<br/><br/>Just answer those questions.
