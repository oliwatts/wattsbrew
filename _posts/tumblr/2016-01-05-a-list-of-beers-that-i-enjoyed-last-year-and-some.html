<p>Sometimes I think the best beers are as much about what’s outside the glass as what’s in it. These beers were ones I really enjoyed sipping last year, along with a little story about why.</p>

<h1><a href="http://adnams.co.uk/beer/our-beers/the-herbalist/">Herbalist - Adnams/Magic Rock</a></h1>

<p>My favourite beer of last year. No exceptions. Such a glorious example of what can result from clever brewing mixed with a sense of fun.</p>

<p>I had the honour of trying this in the Adnams sample room just before it was released. A beer with an incredibly lingering flavour, I could still taste it in my nose for days afterwards.</p>

<p>It’s brewed with Lemon Verbana. Oddly it tastes exactly as it sounds: a zesty, tangy herb that could also double as the name for a second rate punk band. </p>

<p>Hon. mention for Adnams brand new Ease Up Session IPA. A beauty of a thing. Drink it all evening and coat your tongue with maltose and linalool.</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.norfolkbrewhouse.co.uk/moon-gazer-i-26.html">Cellarbration Ale - Norfolk Brewhouse</a></h1>

<p>Had the chance to try this at the Maris Otter 50 festival in Sunny Norwich, organised by The Norfolk Brewhouse et. al.</p>

<p>It’s an Audit Ale, which I believe is an old style of beer that used to be brewed on Uni campuses. Presumably for the post graduate staff to sup</p>

<p>Never mind the style, it’s an ace brew. Mint + Cherries + Chewy penny sweets in a paper bag spread on a buttery rusky base.</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.greatheckbrewery.co.uk/caskales.html">Stormin&rsquo; Normin&rsquo; - Great Heck</a></h1>

<p>This beer was my downfall at my local, The Vic.</p>

<p>Following an afternoon in the sun in the hometown of Suffolk’s best brewer I was in need of refreshment. “A quick pint in The Vic on my way home”, thought I.</p>

<p>Spying Great Heck’s distinctive pumpclips I cockily ordered a pint: “That one, please!”.</p>

<p>That one turned out to be a brute of a beer. It made every point of its 6.5% count.</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.stancillbrewery.co.uk/">Bitter - Stancill</a></h1>

<p>The best bitter in the world. Went particularly well with The Duke of Pork’s amazing dogs in The Vic’s little garden for their annual beer fest.</p>

<p>Yes, The Vic again. Go there, you really should.</p>

<h1>Bitter - Watts &amp;co</h1>

<p>It’s probably a mite arrogant to feature my own beer in this list, but I am rather proud of it.</p>

<p>Brewed for an appearance on the fine Beer O'Clock Show, and finished just before my own little brewery got its final registration sorted, this turned out just as I wanted it.</p>

<p>I love session bitters. They aren’t the sexiest beers alive but good ones have got it where it counts. This one turned out light, lifted by some heady hops with a little crunch of shortbread biscuit. Went down well as the staff beer at the local CAMRA fest too.</p>
