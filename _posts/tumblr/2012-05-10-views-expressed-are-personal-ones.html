<p>Its a common refrain from many Twitter biographies, designed to protect you if what you say doesn&rsquo;t quite fit; but it&rsquo;s worth thinking about what protection it really gives.<br/><br/>If what you do means you have to think or speak on behalf of someone other that just &lsquo;you&rsquo;, can you really separate your brain between work and personal?<br/><br/>Even broader than that, if you need to use the Internet and its easy to find out who you work for, is it simple enough to say any views you&rsquo;ve shared online are really personal ones?<br/><br/>These are interesting questions to consider as the social web becomes ever more pervasive.<br/><br/>By the time I collect my pension my entire working career will have been lived out online.<br/><br/>The blog posts I&rsquo;ve written, tweets about talks I&rsquo;ve given and recommendations from colleagues and clients â€” they&rsquo;ll all be accessible to anyone, anywhere and anytime<br/><br/>Whether you believe in 'social media&rsquo; or not, if you&rsquo;re working in an office based job right now and use the internet in any capacity just have a think about the digital footprint you&rsquo;re going to leave behind, and if there really is such a clear line between personal and professional.</p>
