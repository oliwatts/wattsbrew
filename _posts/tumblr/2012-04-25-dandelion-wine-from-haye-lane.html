<p>A bit of googling inspired by a magnificent spread of Dandelions on the lawn this weekend threw up a tantalisingly easy sounding recipe for wine; amounting to boiling up a load of dandelion leaves with some crushed raisins, adding some yeast and fermenting.<br/><br/>A visit to the in-laws yielded some happily loaned fermenting kit, and the journey home through Haye Lane left us laden with Dandelions.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve just decanted the resultant brew into a demijohn [1. has there ever been a more exotic name for a less glamourous thing?] and it smells wonderful. Heady, gingery and musty, it does kind of smell like you&rsquo;d imagine drunk dandelions to taste.<br/><br/>2 months of delicate fermentation await. I&rsquo;ll let you know how it tastes in June&hellip;<br/><br/>[gallery]</p>
