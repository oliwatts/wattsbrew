<p>It started with a Tweet&hellip;<br/><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/oli/status/217158091970580480">https://twitter.com/oli/status/217158091970580480</a><br/><br/>&hellip;and ended with perfect coffee, and some complimentary cake.<br/><br/><img style="padding-left: 0.5em;" title="Screen Shot 2012-06-26 at 08.49.41" src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-26-at-08.49.41-300x218.png" alt="" width="300" height="218" align="right"/>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting anything when I mentioned the rather horrible coffee from EAT yesterday morning. I was venting. The best I was hoping for was an acknowledgement.<br/><br/>However, the real reason i&rsquo;m impressed is because EAT didn&rsquo;t do anything beyond what they normally do in-store, they just started the conversation online. They offered me a (delicious) replacement, and made sure that I head to EAT when I step out for lunch or need a pick me up in the morning.<br/><br/>It can be easy to forget that &lsquo;social media&rsquo; is mostly just a chance for a direct conversation with someone. If you&rsquo;re a brand or business who does this regularly with your customers over a till point, don&rsquo;t replace what you already know.</p>
