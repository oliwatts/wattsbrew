<a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/">Merlin Mann on The Great Discontent. </a><br/><p>Please may I recommend to you to spend 15 mins reading this outstanding interview of the even outstandinger Merlin Mann. He hits the nail on the head about how to go from want to do something creative and interesting to doing something creative and interesting: <em>actually doing it</em></p>

<blockquote>It’s about doing something, even if it’s stupid, and getting through it as far as you can. It’s not about thinking that you’ll learn from your mistakes. It’s a matter of saying, “Here’s what I learned that I’m capable of that surprised me,” or, “Here’s what I learned I could do, but it takes a lot more time than I thought.” It’s weird: the things that seem easy can be so hard, and the things that seem difficult can be surprisingly enjoyable.</blockquote>
