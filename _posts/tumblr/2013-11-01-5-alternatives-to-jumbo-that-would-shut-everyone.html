<ol><li><em>Take off and nuke the site from orbit, it’s the only way to be sure</em> — Lets bulldoze the site and start again. The building is a beautiful example of Victorian architecture, but is that enough of a reason to use it as a starting point?</li>
<li><em>If music be the food of love, Jumbo on</em> — Another <a href="http://www.batterseapowerstation.co.uk/chelsea-fringe-2013/">prominent old relic</a> is regularly used for performances and as an open arts space. Why not run a little fringe to the Free Fest under the legs? Or a beer festival? Or a regular market?</li>
<li><em>I can see my house from here</em> — The main reason I am interested in Jumbo is because I want to stand on top of its and see what the hell Colchester looks like from up high. How about just doing the bare minimum to make it safe and open it up to visitors for a weekend. There’s been insane interest for <a href="http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/whats-on/events/events-calendar#aldwych">doing this at disused Tube stations,</a> and it’s a good way for Jumbophiles to get their fix.</li>
<li><em>Ebay</em> — Worked for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge#Sale_of_Rennie.27s_bridge_to_Robert_McCulloch">crusty bridge in London</a>, could work for us. Could even invite everyone in Colchester to bring a sledgehammer and slice it up for sale. Postage and packaging might be an issue though.</li>
<li><em>There is no Jumbo, only Zool</em> — The <a href="http://ghostbusters.wikia.com/wiki/Ivo_Shandor">building specs for Jumbo</a> show the use of cold-riveted beams with cores of pure selenium, magnesium-tungsten alloys, and gold plated bolts. I think this is an opportunity to establish Colchester as the primary destination for inter-dimensional travel.</li>
