<p>An amazing video of Rio preparing for carnival, courtesy of <a href="http://twistedsifter.com/2012/02/tilt-shift-carnival-rio-de-janeiro/">TwistedShifter</a>.<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Made by Jarbas Agnelli and Keith Loutit and captured during the Carnival of 2011 with music by Jarbas Agnelli, this wonderful video is made from approximately 170,000 still shots. Just an incredible work of an amazing event. Perfect viewing for a lazy Sunday!</blockquote><br/><br/>I love this video:<br/><br/><li>The music is stunning. The orchestral score for the parade section actually is <strong>samba</strong>, but played on strings.</li>	<li>The tilt-shift effect gives the kind of drunken focus you expect when enjoying a party.</li>	<li>The composition is remarkable. You get to see the entire city, the entire parade.</li>
