Until we moved into our current house last May I never realised quite how much. I used to describe myself as &ldquo;not really practical&rdquo; — I&rsquo;d never really considered spending a weekend figuring out how to plumb in a sink or fixing plasterboard to a wall.<br/><br/>This list might not read as much to you, but it contains some things that I&rsquo;ve done over the past 18 months that I&rsquo;m as proud of as anything else I&rsquo;ve done:<ul><li>Turning the worlds biggest shed into three vegetable patches. [1. And getting a nail in my foot in the process.]</li>	<li>Breaking up a tonne of concrete and turning that into a patio. [2. Breaking up concrete is bloody boring.]</li>	<li>Digging out a tree with never ending roots.</li>	<li>Replacing our shower [3. Required the demolition of an entire wall, rebuilding the wall, and some adventurous plumbing]</li>	<li>Making a proper laundry room out of an under-used utility room.</li></ul>Why am I proud of these things? Because if you&rsquo;d asked me to do anything on that list at the beginning of the year I&rsquo;d have had no idea. Because I&rsquo;ve been able to work in a team with my fantastic family to solve these problems. Because at the end of a hard weekend&rsquo;s work I can stand back and actually see what we&rsquo;ve achieved.<br/><br/><caption id="attachment_1667" align="alignright" width="199"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1667" title="IMG_0233-1" src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_0233-1-199x300.png" alt="" width="199" height="300"/> The ex-shed.</caption><br/><br/>Being able to see the tangible results of my work is really important to me — and its something I can sometimes struggle with when I&rsquo;m dealing with things that can feel nebulous or intangible.<br/><br/>My love of solving practical problems has helped me realise that I actually just love being able to define the problem I&rsquo;ve got to solve, to be able to test a solution and then come up with a final fix. It&rsquo;s not about having a list of easy steps to the solution, but about being confident in the actual, real problem you want to solve and then knowing when you&rsquo;ve fixed it.
