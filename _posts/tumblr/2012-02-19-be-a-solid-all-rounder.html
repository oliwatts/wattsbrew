<p>Bring in plenty of money, but don&rsquo;t be a Salesman.Educate and instruct, but don&rsquo;t be a Teacher.Resolve conflict, but don&rsquo;t be a Mediator.Get hold of the right information, but don&rsquo;t be a Researcher.Understand the real problem, but don&rsquo;t be an Analyst.Understand technology, but don&rsquo;t be a Developer.Get things does to time, budget and quality, but don&rsquo;t be a Project Manager.Craft your words, but don&rsquo;t be a Writer.Connect meaningfully with those that matter, don&rsquo;t be &lsquo;Doing Social Media&rsquo;.Know what makes something desirable and delightful, but don&rsquo;t be a Designer.<br/><br/>Be a solid all rounder.</p>
