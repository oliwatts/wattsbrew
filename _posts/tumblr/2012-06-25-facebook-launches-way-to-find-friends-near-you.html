<p>New feature launched today by Facebook, slightly toward the creepy end of things.<br/><br/>From TechCrunch:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Facebook has created a new feature that lets users find friends and potential friends nearby. Currently Initially called “Friendshake” and also accessible through a URL that is the abbreviation of “find friends nearby” (<a href="http://fb.com/ffn">http://fb.com/ffn</a>), it’s another step in Facebook furthering its reach into mobile, and creating services to meet new people — rather than building up more connectivity with the ones you already know.</blockquote><br/><br/><strong>Updated&hellip;</strong><br/><br/><blockquote>Facebook has quietly removed a controversial feature that would let users on mobile devices find other Facebook users nearby, even if they weren&rsquo;t friends with them on the popular social network.<br/><br/>Courtesy <a href="http://m.cnet.com/news/facebook-quietly-removes-test-friend-finding-feature/57460085">CNet</a></blockquote>
