<p>William Perrin, on the (highly likely) severe disruption due to those of us who work in Holborn during the Olympics:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Every day about 5,000 journalists will trek from Russell Square mainly out East to Stratford and back again.  This will no doubt be good news for local pubs and bars.  There will be a knock-on effect for people who use, live or work near Lincolnâ€™s Inn Fields. </blockquote><br/><br/>There&rsquo;s also a great map which shows restrictions and a scary looking heat map of when transport hell will strike&hellip;<br/><br/>
