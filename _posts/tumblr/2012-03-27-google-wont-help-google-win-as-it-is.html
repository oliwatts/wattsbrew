<p>Brilliant, logical post by Devin Coldewey at TechCrunch about why Google+ should probably just have been the +1 button, and why they also could have waited:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>So why did they jump the gun? The data! That beautiful, plentiful, personal data! Google is a datavore; its reason to exist is to organize all the world’s data, using ads to fund its habit. And on the table before them, a feast unprecedented in depth and variety! Imagine the amount of data produced by a single day of Facebook’s operations. But, like Tantalus, Google is prohibited from reaching and and taking it even though it’s right… there.<br/><br/>Why did Google launch a social network? The same reason a child snatches a cookie from the cookie jar. They simply couldn’t resist.</blockquote>
