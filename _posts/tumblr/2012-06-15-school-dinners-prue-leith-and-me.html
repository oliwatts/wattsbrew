<p>From the lovely NeverSeconds blog all about school dinners, in the press yesterday and today:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>I&rsquo;d really like to know where the chicken comes from so I am going to write to the lady in charge to ask. I know it comes from a hen but I&rsquo;d like to know where the hen lived.</blockquote><br/><br/>This reminds me of a story about me, Prue Leith and silver service dining.<br/><br/>Aged 13, after returning from a particularly nice holiday with my grandparents which featured some especially delicious food, I wrote a letter to the RSA magazine.<br/><br/>Prue Leith has just written an article about how schools don&rsquo;t encourage their pupils to sit, eat and talk together when having their lunch. I agreed with them. They published the article and Prue even wrote me a letter. Precocious 13 year old me was <em>delighted</em>.<br/><br/>My school&rsquo;s response? Wait until I&rsquo;m eating my lunch in front of the whole dining room and bring out a tray with bone chine plates, silver service cutlery, flowers and a cloche. Precocious 13 year old me was <em>mortified</em>.
