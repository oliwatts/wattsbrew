<p>Fantastic, in-depth reportage from Chris Ziegler about the sad, downward slide of Palm:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Thirty-one.<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s the number of months it took Palm, Inc. to go from the darling of International CES 2009 to a mere shadow of itself, a nearly anonymous division inside the HP machine without a hardware program and without the confidence of its owners.</blockquote><br/><br/>A great tale, well told.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m sad about their demise. I think WebOS and their hardware could have been better than what Apple is doing now. It would have been amazing to see how this kind of competition would have changed the tablet and smartphone market. <br/><br/>
