<h2>The Apprentice</h2>

Business is all about money. So profit at all costs.
You are the most important person in the team. 
There is no-one else you can rely on. 
Find the weakest person and crush them. 
You are useless unless you sell. 
Never, ever smile. Business is very serious. 
Don&rsquo;t listen, talk first. 
Money wins. 


<h2>Real Life Business</h2>

Smart business means working as a team.
Your weakest link defines you. So strengthen it. 
Be friendly, be warm and be open.
Sales matter, but what you sell matters more. 
If you&rsquo;re listening you&rsquo;re learning. 
Move with a purpose, but move with thought. 
Smart businesses are the ones that win
