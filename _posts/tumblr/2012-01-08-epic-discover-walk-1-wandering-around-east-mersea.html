<p>The first proper Sunday in 2012 and the first proper walk, heading for a tramp around where we&rsquo;ll be getting married in March.<br/><br/>I picked a geocache [1. Basically a geeky treasure hunt involving clues, GPS and all sorts of curious in-language. Worth a try one afternoon. <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=342e1d71-808a-4463-b841-1eb2d43c5b57">This is the one we did.</a>] in a rather nice little clifftop park called Cudmore Grove in East Mersea as another good reason for getting out.<br/><br/>It appears almost the entire population of East Mersea had the same idea, as we were greeted by a seemingly impromptu dog behaviour class and the abortive practice of the Essex Kite Team (there was no wind). We also didn&rsquo;t manage to find the Geocache, which seemed to have been stolen by the local youth, judging from the spread of Lambrini bottles&hellip;<br/><br/>However, the spectacular view of the chilly north sea from the crumbling cliffs and a spot of lunch by the fireside at The Peldon Rose made up for the lack of a find.<br/><br/>[gallery columns=&ldquo;5&rdquo; link=&ldquo;file&rdquo;]</p>
