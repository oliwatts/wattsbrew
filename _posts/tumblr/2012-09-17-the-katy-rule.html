<blockquote>Even if there was only five minutes left to a meeting, even if Google cofounder Sergey Brin himself was mid sentence and expecting an answer from Katy, Mayer would say &ldquo;Katy&rsquo;s gotta go&rdquo; and Katy would walk out the door and answer the questions later by e-mail after the kids were in bed.&ldquo;</blockquote><br/><br/>Nice little piece from Business Insider about how Google tried to keep hard working employees happy â€” the sentiment being that its the little niggles that add up to frustration, not big grand gestures. I agree with the sentiment. Its about letting people treat their work with the responsibility you&rsquo;d expect.<br/><br/>
