<em>This post also features on the delightful <a href="http://www.colchesterchronicle.co.uk/">Colchester Chronicle</a></em><br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve either lived, studied or worked in Sunny Colch for almost all of my life. Whilst I could happily point you in the direction of the finest watering hole (The Brickies, Bergholt Road) or the highlight of the cultural calendar (Colchester Beer Festival. I sense a theme developing&hellip;) I couldn&rsquo;t tell you much about its history, beyond something to do with the Romans.<br/><br/>An attempt to remedy this myself and my dear wife chalked our names up for a Walking Tour through the excellent <a href="http://www.visitcolchester.com/">Visit Colchester</a> interweb site.<br/><br/>Our tour guide, Anne, was superb. I doubt there could have been a finer way to look afresh at buildings and roads I&rsquo;ve walked along for years.<br/><br/>Below are some of my favourite facts from our walk this morning. No doubt some of them may be familiar to many, but they&rsquo;re enjoyable nonetheless:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Camulodunum is not a &lsquo;Roman&rsquo; name,</strong> its an adaptation of the original name for the town — Camulo<u>dunon</u>. The name comes from Camulus, the God of War of the Trinovantes, who were the 'original&rsquo; inhabitants of Sunny Colch.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>Colchester was probably one of the first places in the UK to encounter an Elephant.</strong> The Roman Emperor Claudius brought them ashore when he originally laid siege and conquerered the town in AD 43.</li><br/><br/><li>Firstsite/The VAF/Golden Goose/Bronze Banana is one of the finest buildings our town has to offer.</li><br/><br/><li>The lovely shops towards the top of Eld Lane which look like houses were originally houses. Alms Houses.</li><br/><br/><li>West and East Stockwell Street get their name from a well at their bottom which provided water for livestock to drink whilst being driven to market.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The tiny door way you can see on Holy Trinity Church from Trinity Street is called the 'Devil&rsquo;s Door&rsquo;.</strong> It was built so that the devil, unleashed by the cries of child being baptised, wouldn&rsquo;t be able to open its wings and escape.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The narrow, terracotta bricks you see on many of Colchester&rsquo;s oldest buildings are actually Roman Bricks,</strong> which are similar in size and shape to a small paving slab. As the town grew they were 'recycled&rsquo; for new building projects.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The building currently housing Superdry in Culver Square used be the town library</strong>, and was requisitioned in the Second World War. The entire Culver Square precinct was built on top of the Roman Barracks, and remnants of Boudica&rsquo;s famous ramapage were found in the form of charred earth when building started.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The Arts Centre lost the top of its tower when it was shelled in the Civil War.</strong> An unfortunate chap named 'One Eyed Gunner Thompson&rsquo; and his 'egg shaped cannon&rsquo; were also lost, one of the possible origins of the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme.</li><br/><br/><li>Balkerne Gate is no named after it was Balked (filled in) once the Romans left.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The parade of shops at the top of the high street are housed in the old Fire Station.</strong> The entire outside of the building is made of iron, just to make sure it couldn&rsquo;t be burnt down&hellip;</li><br/><br/><li>The building which currently houses Pizza Express used to be an agricultural showroom in the 19th Century, hence the huge glass windows.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The Dutch Quarter should actually be called the Flemish Quarter.</strong> Most of the weavers who came to Colchester weren&rsquo;t from Holland, they were from Belgium.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>Jumbo is still very beautiful, even from close up.</strong> This was the closest I&rsquo;d ever gotten to it, and catching sight of it as I pull into North Station will be even sweeter having been close up to the old thing.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>The Town Hall Tower is called the Victoria Tower and is topped by a statue of St. Helena, facing in the direction of Jerusalem.</strong> The ravens sat around her are a symbol of the Hythe Port, and the figures around the middle of the tower symbolise the main sources of prosperity for Colch — agriculture, the military and fishing.</li><br/><br/></ul><br/><br/>The most exciting find for me on the whole tour was <strong>St. Martins, the church found along West Stockwell Street</strong>. The Church looks tiny from the outside but is deliciously peaceful and rather large inside. One of the most interesting features was a 'squint&rsquo; — a portal cut through the wall so that the poorer members of the congregation could see the action.<br/><br/>The tours run most weekends and ours took slightly longer than the 90 minutes (we were a chatty bunch). You can find out more and book <a href="http://www.visitcolchester.com/thedms.aspx?dms=12&amp;groupid=1&amp;nd=All&amp;startdate=Today&amp;f=Colchester+Guided+Tours">here</a>. Get yourself along when you can, it&rsquo;ll leave you with a feeling that you&rsquo;ve scratched a bit deeper into the surface of our little old town.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[gallery]
