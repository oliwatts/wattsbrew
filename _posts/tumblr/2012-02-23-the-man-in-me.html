<p>Easily my favourite Dylan song, featured in definitely my favourite movie.[1. The Big Lebowski. It plays during the title sequence and the after The Rug is stolen.]<br/><br/>The lyrics make me feel happy every time I hear them:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>The man in me will do nearly any taskAs for compensation, there&rsquo;s a little he will askTake a woman like youTo get through to the man in me.<br/><br/>Storm clouds are raging all around my doorI think to myself I might not take it anymoreTake a woman like your kindTo find the man in me.<br/><br/>But, oh what a wonderful feelingJust to know that you are nearIt sets my heart a-reelingFrom my toes up to my ears.<br/><br/>The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seenBut that&rsquo;s just because he doesn&rsquo;t want to turn into some machineTake a woman like youTo get through to the man in me.</blockquote><br/><br/>You can read more about the track <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_Me">here.</a>
