<p>Word of Mouth ponders possibly the most important of all culinary questions in as article which is almost as satisfying to read as a fry up is to eat:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>To grill or fry? Fry. This is not a healthy meal. Trying to pretend it is - and cooking your bacon in a Breville - will ruin it. Grilled breakfasts lack grease. It&rsquo;s not just beans and a runny yolk that provide moisture. You need that lip-smacking lubrication provided by slowly-fried unpricked sausages and bacon.</blockquote>
