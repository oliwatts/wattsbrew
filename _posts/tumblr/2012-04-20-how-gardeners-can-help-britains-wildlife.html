<p>Kate Bradbury writes about how the countryside isn&rsquo;t really able to support native wildlife anymore â€” and that we should try and use garden space to try and balance that.<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Meadows, woodland, hedgerows, even long stubby bits of grass, all represent habitats for some creature or other. Gardens can&rsquo;t make up for the loss of these landscapes, but they can provide habitats for some of our more adaptable wildlife.</blockquote><br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve just planted out a native hedge of Elderflower, Blackberries and Raspberries in our garden. <br/><br/>Plants like this are extremely cheap [1. You can get bareroot plants for pence when they are in season. See <a href="http://www.ashridgetrees.co.uk/Native-Hedging">here</a>] and grow like weeds with the added benefit of providing a glut of fruit and some much needed native habitat.
