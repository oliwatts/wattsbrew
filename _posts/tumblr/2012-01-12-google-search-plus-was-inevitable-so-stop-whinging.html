<p>Google made a pretty big change to their search product this week - meaning that people and pages from Google+ now appear alongside your search results. Similar results from Twitter and Facebook do not.<br/><br/>Predictably this has caused a stink, predominantly from Twitter, who allege that the changes will &lsquo;make it harder for people to find information&rsquo;. [1. <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15633422401/twitter-responds-to-antitrust">http://parislemon.com/post/15633422401/twitter-responds-to-antitrust</a>]<br/><br/>Whilst this has undoubtedly changed the playing field for social marketing and search marketing quite significantly [2. For a start, brands will really seriously need to think about getting their presence sorted on Google+. I expect to see some quite big advertising products from Google over the next few months helping brands target fans of their pages across the whole of their ad network.], I think we need to remember something:<br/><br/>Google (and Twitter and Facebook) are completely free for end users.<br/><br/>As tools for communication and research they are almost priceless, yet it doesn&rsquo;t cost any of us a penny to use them.<br/><br/>Just like Twitter [3. See my post on <a title="Twitter is now an advertising business" href="http://obilog.co.uk/twitter-is-now-an-advertising-business/">how Twitter is now an advertising business</a>.] and Facebook, Google is an advertising business.<br/><br/>To sell more ads they need to know as much about you as possible, and have as much traffic as possible.<br/><br/>Putting Google+ next to normal searches means brands can&rsquo;t ignore that presence. They will be forced to actively used it, and will eventually become Google&rsquo;s customers.<br/><br/>If we want to be able to use such powerful tools for free but have other people paying for them, we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised when the companies that run them aggressively protect their business.</p>
