<p>Logging in to Facebook this morning I saw a call out at the top of the news feed, directing me to this page:<br/><br/><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-424" title="Facebook explains its advertising" src="http://79.125.106.66/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/22-12-2011-11-02-21-300x218.png" alt="Facebook explains its advertising" width="300" height="218"/></p><h6><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/">About Advertising on Facebook</a></h6>The page explains how Facebook uses advertising to make money and keep the service free. Its a sensible thing to explain, and a neat way of putting down the &lsquo;OMG Facebook will start charging soon&rsquo; memes, however the timing is a bit odd. I guess its another salvo in the battle to prove Facebook takes privacy seriously.
