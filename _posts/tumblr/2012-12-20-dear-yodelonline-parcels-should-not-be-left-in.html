<p>Like several other people, I&rsquo;ve made use of the Internet for Christmas shopping. Its marvellous. I press a button and shiny toys appear at my door.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the deep, significant, misfortune of having one of those presents be &lsquo;delivered&rsquo; by Yodel. The delivery date came and went with no parcel. I couldn&rsquo;t raise anyone on the phone, and the tracking information said the parcel had been delivered.</p>

<p>Where was it?&hellip;</p>

<p>This morning, my neighbours made an exciting discovery. The parcel <strong>had</strong> been delivered. Well, I say delivered. What I mean was: &ldquo;Left outside in the rain for three days&rdquo;. The card you can see? Left with the parcel.</p>

<p>Needless to say the contents (a record player) haven&rsquo;t taken well to the moist environment&hellip;</p>

<p>

Just in case you&rsquo;re interested, the disappearance of the parcel was mildly annoying (given that its a Christmas present). I managed to order a totally new one which was actually delivered by DPD <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> within 12 hours.

Let&rsquo;s hope I&rsquo;m the only one who&rsquo;s been left with a soggy box by Yodel this Christmas.

<p>You know, door bell goes, parcel is kept dry, parcel is taken inside. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
