<p><a href="http://www.harry-watts.co.uk/">My brother</a> arranged a surprise stag weekend for me in Southwold, home of the finest cask ale in the land, Adnams.<br/><br/>I can&rsquo;t tell you how much the weekend meant to me. I am of the opinion that there&rsquo;s nothing more fantastic than spending time with the people you care most about in life.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s what I love about Adnams as a brand; it feels like they believe the same thing. They take real pride in their work, and it shows. They love their product, which isn&rsquo;t just beer, but a way of bringing your favourite people together in a warm environment.<br/><br/>8 of us spent two nights at <a href="http://adnams.co.uk/stay-with-us/the-brewers-house">The Brewer&rsquo;s House</a>, a four bedroom town house right in the middle of Southwold, and next door to the Adnams Brewery. Considering beach huts in the town can <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/suffolk/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8457000/8457946.stm">sell for upwards of Â£40,000</a>, even when derelict, this was a serious bit of property.<br/><br/>The house was originally one of the perks of the Head Brewer&rsquo;s job[1. Sadly, not the case for Fergus, Adnams&rsquo; current Head Brewer, who took us on a tour of the brew house, and distillery :)] but is now available for holiday lets.<br/><br/>As you might expect from a company which prides itself on running some of the best public houses, hotels and restaurants in East Anglia, the house was stunning.<br/><br/>Tastefully decorated with some incredible and original Adnams artwork throughout, a cigar-smoking courtyard, a kitchen able to seat and sate your best friends and perhaps the most comfortable bed I&rsquo;ve slept in for ages.[2. After 5 pints&hellip;].<br/><br/>[gallery link=&ldquo;file&rdquo;]</p>
