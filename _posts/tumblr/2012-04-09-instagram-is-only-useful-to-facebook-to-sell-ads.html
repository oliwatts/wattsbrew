<p>Instagram&rsquo;s Kevin Systrom, speaking at the Federated Media’s Signal in March this year:</p><blockquote>“Our atomic unit of communication on Instagram is an image,” Systrom says. “Advertisers all around the world speak in images.” [1. <a href="http://m.techcrunch.com/2012/03/21/kevin-systrom-fm-signal/">More here</a>]</blockquote>Facebook knows that its inability to make money from its mobile products is a potentially major risk to its upcoming IPO.<br/><br/>From their S-1 filing:<blockquote>We do not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products, and our ability to do so successfully is unproven. [2. <a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm">Full document here</a>]</blockquote>I think the real reason for the Instagram purchase, and the incredible price tag, is access to a potentially lucrative mobile advertising product.
