<p>$180,000,000 is a lot to pay for a company. Especially one which has only really been popular for 6 weeks.<br/><br/>OMGpop, a small network of largely flash based games released &lsquo;Draw Something&rsquo;, a game for iOS and Android where you draw a picture and your friend guesses it. It may sound extremely familiar, but its incredibly addictive. [1. Which you can download for iPhone <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/draw-something-by-omgpop/id488627858?mt=8&amp;uo=4">here</a>.]<br/><br/>As usually accompanies runway hits on the social web, the app achieved multi-million numbers of active users and downloads, and (reportedly) billions of drawings shared. After 6 weeks of this success, OMGpop were bought by Zynga, the current doyennes of the 'social gaming&rsquo; world, and publishers of FarmVille, Words with Friends. [2. <a href="http://m.techcrunch.com/2012/03/23/zynga-we-bought-omgpop-for-180m-pincus-to-sell-15-percent-of-shares-in-secondary-offering/">As per Techcrunch</a>]<br/><br/>When I first started working with the web, the dot-com bubble was in full deflate mode. [3. <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=984776400000&amp;chddm=108190&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC&amp;ntsp=0">March 10, 2000, when the NASDAQ peaked at 5132.52 in intraday trading before closing at 5048.62</a> ] Acquisitions like OMGpop&rsquo;s were unheard of. The story instead was of companies like Boo.com; painting themselves into a corner with insane valuations, ruinously expensive offices and no revenue. [4. A must read is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boo-Hoo-Dot-Com-Story/dp/0099418371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333351090&amp;sr=8-1">Boo Hoo</a>, an incredible chronicle of boo.com&rsquo;s journey. Amazing book]<br/><br/>In the last 10+ years the landscape which both of these companies operates in has changed dramatically, but what are some of the key reasons why one succeeded, and the other failed?<br/><br/>Boo.com was attempted to innovate in an established market. Zynga has created an established market entirely from scratch. Why did the innovation fail and the creation ofnew market succeed?<br/><br/></p><ol><li><strong>Simplicity of route to market.</strong>Boo.com had to build an international logisitics network. Zynga publishes a game directly to its customers pockets through the app store.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>We know what is shit.</strong> Boo.com needed to hire smart people with no experience of running a technology business (because almost no-one had). Zynga can hire from the pick of the people with the last 10 years experience.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>Quality of product.</strong> Boo.com required two things most people didn&rsquo;t have: a fast modem and a fast computer. Zynga can rely on the fact that it&rsquo;s customers have a powerful and highly connected device to consume their products.</li><br/><br/><li><strong>Price point.</strong> Boo.com sold luxury products with a premium price tag. Zynga sells games with an average price of around Â£1.69 </li></ol>
