<p>Inni is the second &lsquo;live&rsquo; film by Sigur R贸s, following a tour documentary from 2007 called Heima. That film was a lavish affair, following the band around Iceland. Inni couldn&rsquo;t be more different.<br/><br/>Originally filmed at Ally Pally in 2008, the footage for Inni was then transferred to 16mm film, projected on a screen and re-filmed with effects created by placing translucent objects in front of the projection. [1. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/09/16/140471649/first-watch-sigur-r-s-inni">http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/09/16/140471649/first-watch-sigur-r-s-inni</a>]<br/><br/>The result is quite staggering. You are immersed in an exceptionally lo-res black and white world, with a feeling of being at one end of a dark tunnel with the band at the other. At times, it felt like watching a silent movie with a musical accompaniment.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of watching Sigur R贸s live 3 times, twice at the Hammersmith Apollo. The sound quality of their live performance is, literally, breathtaking. Inni isn&rsquo;t the best place to start if you&rsquo;ve no knowledge of the band, but as a cinematic example of how it feels to be at a Sigur R贸s concert it was exquisite.<br/><br/>Complements must go to <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/artson5/">The Lakeside Theatre</a> for deciding to show the film. I&rsquo;ve not been back to the University of Essex campus since working there almost 10 years ago. It&rsquo;s pretty exciting to see how much it&rsquo;s changed.</p>
