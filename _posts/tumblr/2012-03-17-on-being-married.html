<p>I am an emotive chap â€” and one given to almost professional levels of Irrational Worry.<br/><br/>The last few weeks have been the best of my life, and as they come to a close I&rsquo;ve been pondering why.<br/><br/>Getting married was important to me because it&rsquo;s a chance to let the world know how much you know you love your partner. <br/><br/>It also offered a chance to bring all our favourite people together and celebrate.<br/><br/>Being married isn&rsquo;t the only way to do these things, but I found it the easiest.<br/><br/>The excitement of those few weeks has left me feeling pleasantly settled, and scarily confident that I&rsquo;ll be able to navigate the next 50+ years contented, challenged and happy.</p>
