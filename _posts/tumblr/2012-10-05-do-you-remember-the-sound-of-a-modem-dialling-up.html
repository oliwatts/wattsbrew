<p>From John Pemberton at The Atlantic. A fine piece about those nostalgic electronic chirrups that I remember dearly:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Of all the noises that my children will not understand, the one that is nearest to my heart is not from a song or a television show or a jingle. Itâ€™s the sound of a modem connecting with another modem across the repurposed telephone infrastructure. It was the noise of being part of the beginning of the Internet.</blockquote><br/><br/>Also worth a browse is the <a href="http://savethesounds.info/">Museum of Endangered Sounds</a>. Utterly wonderful. Features gems like the Encarta MindMaze game, the chunky and delicious sound of a floppy disk loading and the glorious Windows 95 startup sound.<br/><br/>
