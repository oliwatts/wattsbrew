<p>Occasionally, only the purest form of cocktail will do.<br/><br/>You will need:</p><ul><li>Gin [1. Any kind you like. I find either Tanqueray, <a href="http://cellarandkitchen.adnams.co.uk/catalog/product/spirits-1/adnams-first-rate-gin-48abv-50cl">Adnams First Rate</a> or Waitrose London Gin works.]</li>	<li>Vodka [2. This is there to make the Martini a bit stronger, like the Gin is a mixer or something. Use a decent one like Stoli.]</li>	<li>Lillet [3. Yes, this is the &lsquo;vermouth&rsquo; famously ordered in Casino Royale. It gives the Martini a golden hue and delicious. More <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillet">here</a>.]</li>	<li>Ice. Plenty and freezer fresh.</li>	<li>Lemon. Don&rsquo;t use a waxed one, you&rsquo;ll need the peel.</li>	<li>Zester.</li>	<li>Cocktail shaker, strainer.</li></ul>Steps to heaven:<ol><li>Place a handful of ice (or two if you&rsquo;ve small hands) into the bottom of the cocktail mixer.</li>	<li>Add 3 measures of gin, 1 measure of vodka and half a measure of Lillet. [4. I keep the Gin and Vodka in the freezer. That way when they are mixed with the ice there is the minimum amount of dilution, but the maximum amount of deliciously alcoholic ice slush.]</li>	<li>Pop the top of the cocktail shaker on top securely and shake, don&rsquo;t stir. [5. The shaking bashes up the ice cubes into little shards of ice. It makes the Martini more like slush, which might sound horrendous but is actually amazing.]</li>	<li>Strain the delicious solution into a proper cocktail glass.</li>	<li>Holding the lemon over the top of the glass, use the zester to twist off a long strip of peel. [6. Keeping the lemon over the top of the glass gives the drink a squirt of lovely lemony oils which works really nicely with the gin.]</li>	<li>Drink. Slowly or quickly depending on your day.</li></ol><div><br/><br/>[gallery link=&ldquo;file&rdquo;]<br/><br/></div>
