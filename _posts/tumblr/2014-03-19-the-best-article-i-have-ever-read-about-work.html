<a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027499/career-rocket-fuel-whether-youre-a-millennial-or-eyeing-retirement-heres-what-you-really-nee">The best article I have ever read about work. </a><br/><blockquote>
  <p><em>Take the number 62 and deduct your current age.</em>
  This is the number of years you have left until early retirement. Of course, nobody retires early anymore. This number is a shock to most people. If youâ€™re in your late 20s, you have almost 35 years of your career left. Even if you are 40, you are not even at the halfway pole.</p>
