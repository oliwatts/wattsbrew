<p>Great article from Ars Technica back in June, talking about Winamp, the doyenne of digital music:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>“There&rsquo;s no reason that Winamp couldn’t be in the position that iTunes is in today if not for a few layers of mismanagement by AOL that started immediately upon acquisition,” Rob Lord, the first general manager of Winamp, and its first-ever hire, told Ars.</blockquote><br/><br/>Reading this made me remember with fondness the heady days of 2000, Napster and Winamp. <br/><br/>
