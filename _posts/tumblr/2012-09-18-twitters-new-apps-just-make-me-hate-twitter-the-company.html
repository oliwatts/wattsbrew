<p>Twitter&rsquo;s ground breaking innovation [1. Copying features from Facebook]  continues: </p><blockquote>New profiles now feature header photos so you can express who you are more meaningfully on Twitter. Upload an image from your mobile device and see the same beautiful profile design on your phone, tablet or computer. Read more about the new profiles.</blockquote><br/><br/>I gave the new apps a whirl today and instantly missed Tweetbot. Why?<br/><br/><ul><li>I can&rsquo;t mute annoying hashtags, people or topics. [2. Ironically, if you think about Twitter&rsquo;s revenue stream: Ads, I&rsquo;m not surprised.]</li>	<li>Lists are buried. Annoying If you&rsquo;ve spent any time making Lists to keep track of people.</li>	<li>Twitter isn&rsquo;t a rich media platform. I don&rsquo;t want a cover photo or photo albums. I want an easy way to share bits of text with my friends.</li></ul><br/><br/>Also, Twitter just killed Twitpic. The official Twitter photo service is the only way to share images now. What&rsquo;s next? Turning off integration with other major social networks? <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=twitter+turns+off+tumblr&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;client=safari">Imagine that!</a>
