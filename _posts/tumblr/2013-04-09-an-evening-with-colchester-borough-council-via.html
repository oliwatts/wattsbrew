<a href="http://www.colchesterchronicle.co.uk/2013/04/09/cbc-customers-and-cash/">An evening with Colchester Borough Council (via @colchchronic)</a><br/><p>Another fine post from The Chronic about yesterday’s introduction to Colchester Borough Council by CEO Adrian Pritchard.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But do folk around Sunny Colch know who Adrian Pritchard is? We don’t want to increase to his already heavy workload, but he should be rolled out more often at these type of events. You needn’t employ some hyped up marketing consultant to pay lip service to the town when the Chief Exec is already signed up to the vision of celebrating what Colchester has to offer..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was there to listen to Adrian last night, and I couldn’t agree more with the quote above. He did a great job of explaining the complexity and possibilities that lie ahead for CBC.</p>

<p>I said during the Q&amp;A that CBC should encourage everyone to communicate more. I think they took an important step forward last night. I look forward to supporting them as they do even more.</p>
