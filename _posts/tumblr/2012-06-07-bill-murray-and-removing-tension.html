<p>Bill Murray, interviewed by GQ:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>People confuse friendship and relaxation. It&rsquo;s incredibly important to be relaxed â€” you don&rsquo;t have a chance if you&rsquo;re not relaxed. So I try very hard to relax any kind of tension. But friendship is different.</blockquote><br/><br/>Wonderful piece.<br/><br/>
