<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130916/twitters-third-act-a-new-design-to-court-the-mainstream/">Twitter's next big change is coming, and it makes it sound more like Facebook than ever. </a><br/><blockquote>Twitter has lots of users. It wants a lot more.

That is, in part, why it is planning a massive overhaul of its mobile apps, designed to make the service more appealing to mainstream users.</blockquote>

And

<blockquote>Sources said that Twitter is experimenting with another stream dedicated solely to TV-related tweets and conversations, one which will likely find its way into Twitter’s redesigned app.</blockquote>

Thank god. We definitely need another ‘media platform’…
