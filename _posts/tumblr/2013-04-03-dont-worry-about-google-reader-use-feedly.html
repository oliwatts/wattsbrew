<a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Don't worry about Google Reader. Use Feedly instead</a><br/><p>Only just discovered what might be one of the coolest tools I’m come across in a while.</p>

<p>Feedly is a simple feed reader. It is brilliant because it is not Flipboard/Pulse/another VC-backed social magazine.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how hard it is to make a good app about reading. Flipboard is a pain in the arse because it tries to be too clever. I don’t want a machine to editorialise for me – if I want a magazine I’ll subscribe to one made by people.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I want a simple, easy to navigate list of articles which won’t die when Google Reader does. Feedly does just that.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>You should too, its called The Magazine and its ace. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>

</ol></div>
