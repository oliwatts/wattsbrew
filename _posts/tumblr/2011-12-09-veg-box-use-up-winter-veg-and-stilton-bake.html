<p>Sometimes there are evenings where you need comfort food. Sometimes there are also evenings where you need to use up the veg box.<br/><br/>Oh yes, that was this evening :)<br/><br/><strong>Winter Veg and Stilton Bake</strong><br/><br/>One medium leekTwo small white onionsTwo medium carrotsFour medium sized potatoesOne small savoy cabbageSplash of any old white winePinch of cinnamon, cumin, cardamom and sichuan pepper75g butter and 75g flour150ml milkHunks of cheddar, bigger hunk of Stilton and smaller chunk of hard cheese.<br/><br/>Chop up the potatoes and carrots so they&rsquo;re all about the same size. Don&rsquo;t peel them as peeling veg is for fools. Cover them in a little water and get them boiling.<br/><br/>While your spuds and carrots are boiling chop up and sweat the leeks and onions in a little olive oil. Add in the spices and cook them briefly. Chop the cabbage finely and throw in the pan and stir with the oniony leeky mix. After a couple of minutes add in the splash of wine and turn down the heat!<br/><br/>By this time (or 12 minutes) the spuds will be done. Drain them and leave them in the hot pan so they keep steaming.<br/><br/>Now it&rsquo;s time to make the gorgeous sauce.<br/><br/>Add the butter and flour to a small saucepan. Gently melt the butter until you&rsquo;ve got a roux (a paste). Slowly and lovingly add the milk so you get a nice smooth sauce, and gently keep heating to cook the flour. ADD THE CHEESE!<br/><br/>Final step. Mash up the potatoes and carrots so they&rsquo;re a little bit lumpy (for texture). Then stir in the cabbage-leek-onion-spice mixture. Finally add the gorgeous sauce.<br/><br/>Spoon into a dish, place in the oven until its golden brown.<br/><br/>[gallery link=&ldquo;file&rdquo; columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo;]<br/><br/>Eat.</p>
