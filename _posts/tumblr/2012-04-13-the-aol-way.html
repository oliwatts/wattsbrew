<p>BusinessInsider published a leaked version of &lsquo;The AOL Way&rsquo; over 12 months ago, but I&rsquo;ve just found it thanks to Clay Johnson&rsquo;s fab &rsquo;<a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/">The Information Diet</a>&rsquo;.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a fascinating document which explains the detail behind AOL&rsquo;s content production business; their farm.<br/><br/>Everything is driven towards getting you to spend more time on an AOL site, generating page views to increase advertising revenue.<br/><br/>As an exercise in ruthless commercial growth it&rsquo;s very impressive, but it&rsquo;s also another example of how many large digital businesses are really just an advertising platform.<br/><br/></p>
