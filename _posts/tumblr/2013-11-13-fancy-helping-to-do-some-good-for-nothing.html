<p>The internet is great, but it can make it seductively easy to feel like you might be making a difference about something you might care about when you’re not.</p>

<p>Starting next week in Colchester there’s an opportunity to change this a little bit.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>Good for Nothing is a national network of groups that get together to do good, for nothing. It encourages people to come out from hiding behind their screen, meet new people and make a bit of a difference. It is not about talking, but doing.</p>

<p>We are hosting the first of a series of weekend get togethers <em>next weekend</em>, bringing a group of interesting people together to look at real challenges being faced by local groups working to make our community better.</p>

<h3>What does this actually mean?</h3>

<p>It’s a chance to spend a few hours over the weekend contributing (any) skills you have to helping a good cause.</p>

<p>The causes who are looking for help will be present what they need and you’ll have a chance to offer your support to any or all of them over the course of the get together. </p>

<p>We’ll be meeting on the evening of Friday 22nd November and during the day of Saturday 23rd November at the marvellous Waiting Room in St. Botolph’s, Colchester. </p>

<h3>But how can I help?</h3>

<p>You may be a writer, designer or coder; artist, photographer or business owner.</p>

<p>You also might be <em>none</em> of those things. It doesn’t matter. You can help by wanting to share your brain power on how to solve a few problems for your community.</p>

<h3>What do I get from dragging myself out of bed at the weekend?</h3>

<p>A few things actually:</p>

<ul><li>Meeting cool new people from across your town, interested in the same thing as you.</li>
<li>A chance to help build something tangible that will help a local good cause.</li>
<li>Food and drink, including beer donated by Adnams and cyder donated by Aspalls</li>
</ul><h3>Where do I sign?</h3>
