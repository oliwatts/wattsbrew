<p>This is our first year of having an open fire. It&rsquo;s marvellous. I&rsquo;ve learnt some things about them:</p><ol><li>First, get your chimney swept by someone from the <a href="http://www.nacs.org.uk/">National Association of Chimney Sweeps</a>. Chimney fires ain&rsquo;t no joke.</li>	<li>The wood absolutely, positively has to be properly seasoned. This means it&rsquo;s completely dry. Those bags of logs from Homebase? They&rsquo;re not even close to being right and you&rsquo;re wasting your time. Look for a local tree surgeon who has seasoned the wood for at least 2 years.</li>	<li>Decent kindling is really important too. You can make this yourself by using some off cuts from a builders merchants or by buying some cheap pieces of pine and chopping into small pieces.</li>	<li>You will burn your fingers. Many times.</li>	<li>The Evening Standard isn&rsquo;t very good for starting fires, neither is The Metro. Any paper which has ink that is permanent won&rsquo;t burn very well.</li>	<li>Build your fire in a pyramid, adding new logs on a slant so they burn with plenty of air.</li>	<li>Finally, you&rsquo;ll need a log store if you&rsquo;re going to keep any useful amount of wood. Anything which allows the wood to be stacked with enough air around and a secure roof.</li></ol>
