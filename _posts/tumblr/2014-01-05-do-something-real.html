<a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/">Do something real.</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>When I am in a foul mood, I have a surefire way to improve my outlook – I build something. A foul mood is a stubborn beast and it does not give ground easily. It is an effort to simply get past the foulness in order to start building, but once the building has begun, the foul beast loses ground.</p>
  
  <p>I don’t know what cascading chemical awesomeness is going down in my brain when it detects and rewards me for the act of building, but I’m certain that the hormonal cocktail is the end result of millions of years of evolution. Part of the reason we’re at the top of the food chain is that we are chemically rewarded when we are industrious – it is evolutionarily advantageous to be productive.</p>
  
  <p>And we’re slowly and deviously being trained to forget this.</p>

<p>This is simply excellent, and exactly how I feel. It&rsquo;s easy to get the illusion of doing something. It&rsquo;s like junk food instead of real nourishment.</p>
