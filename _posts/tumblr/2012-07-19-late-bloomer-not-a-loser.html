<p>Such a great post from Dave McClure, found via the excellent <a href="http://svbtle.com">Svbtle</a> blogging network:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>and so here I am: still standing in the arena, in hand-to-hand combat with demons mostly of my own making, aiming to make a small dent in the universe. nowhere near a great success story, yet fighting the good fight and perhaps helping others to achieve greatness as I attempt a bit of my own.</blockquote><br/><br/>Captures the slight persistent anxiety which comes with not quite being sure how or where you fit in to everything&hellip;
