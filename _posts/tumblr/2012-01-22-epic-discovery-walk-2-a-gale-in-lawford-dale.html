<p>A proper, epic walk this week, taking in 11 caches all around Lawford Dale. Starting at the beautiful St. Mary&rsquo;s Church and snaking around the allotments, sugar beet fields and woodland of Northern Essex&rsquo;s finest peninsula. It was quite a trek.<br/><br/>Highlights included possibly the strongest winds known to man, a biblical sized pile of sugar beet just waiting for the trip up the A14 and some Essex Beaver [1. A rather terrifying errant page from a tractor drivers jazz stash&hellip;]<br/><br/>We also had an introduction to magnetic micro-caches - impossibly small magnetic containers affixed onto anything metallic, whether its a rusty gate or a fence nail (well found, Sarah!).<br/><br/>[gallery link=&ldquo;file&rdquo;]</p>
