<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be cynical when you work in marketing, especially if your work involves the web, and &lsquo;social media&rsquo;.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s easy because a lot of the time things get made more complicated than they need to be. There&rsquo;s obfuscation between what people think the social web does, and what it actually can do.<br/><br/>Let me give you a really lovely example. You might have heard about it, but stick with me.<br/><br/>Karen Klein is a 68-year old school bus monitor, in New York State. In a rather shocking turn of events the students she rides with on the bus every day turned on her, subjecting her to some pretty nasty personal abuse.<br/><br/>As is the trend with almost everything, one of the students filmed the footage and posted it online. The video quickly gained people&rsquo;s attention, and someone figured out the identity of the poor lady being reduced to tears.<br/><br/><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1500" title="Screen Shot 2012-07-16 at 19.09.30" src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-Shot-2012-07-16-at-19.09.30-300x229.png" alt="" width="300" height="229"/><br/><br/>This is where the magic happens. Someone who&rsquo;d never met Karen decided they wanted to support her. They set up a page where people could donate money towards a holiday for her.<br/><br/>To date, there&rsquo;s over <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/loveforkarenhklein">$680,000 donated</a>, by people who don&rsquo;t know Karen, and will probably never meet her.<br/><br/>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, technology&rsquo;s role is to help us do things in a better/faster/bigger/safer way.<br/><br/>50 years ago, had this happened to Karen, the support network that would have rallied around her would have been her immediate local community, with the information passed around by a particularly powerful 'social network&rsquo; - the playground.<br/><br/>In 2012 its an iPhone, YouTube and thousands of people using a crowd-funding platform. The result is the same, but the impact is much, much more powerful.<br/><br/><strong>Why is any of this important?</strong><br/><br/>Professionally, my job is to help organisations make use of the social web, perhaps to promote a brand or to support a marketing campaign.<br/><br/>For me, the best return you&rsquo;ll ever see on your investment in the social web is when you work out how you can build a genuine, shared connection with people and do it — honestly and openly.<br/><br/>Remember that the social web is just a bigger, better and more powerful way to connect with people. Embrace that. Don&rsquo;t make it any more complicated than it needs to be.</p>
