<a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22028682">Remembering The Secret of Monkey Island</a><br/><p>Fun little piece from the BBC about one of the finest games ever made – The Secret of Monkey Island.</p>

<blockquote>“When Monkey Island came out, it didn’t do very well,” says Ron Gilbert, Monkey Island co-creator and former LucasArts employee.

“It wasn’t a huge seller, it didn’t get incredibly good reviews. It has just been through the years that the game has attracted this big following.”
