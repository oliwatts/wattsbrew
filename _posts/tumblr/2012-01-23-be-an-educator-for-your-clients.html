<p>Doreen Lorenzo, President Frog Design:</p><blockquote>You only have to educate a good client for a short amount of time. Because, once you educate them, there’s this trust factor that happens between you and the client. So you might educate them the first couple of projects, but the third, fourth, fifth project they’re listening to you. And you’re coming up with ideas – because you know them, and you know what’s good for them – and they’re listening to you. That’s where the real magic happens.[1. <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/6983/Doreen-Lorenzo-Clients-Donat-Deserve-Surprises">http://the99percent.com/articles/6983/Doreen-Lorenzo-Clients-Donat-Deserve-Surprises</a>]</blockquote>Richard Millington, Founder of Feverbee:<blockquote><p style="text-align: left;">We&rsquo;ve lost more than a few clients by trying to give them what they need, not what they want. I have no regrets though.[2. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/RichMillington/status/161512742732308480">http://twitter.com/#!/RichMillington/status/161512742732308480</a>]</p></blockquote>If you work in a client/agency relationship, one of the most valuable things you can be is an Educator.<br/><br/>Quite often, in the daily grist and grind of delivering things, it&rsquo;s very easy to forget that you&rsquo;ve been hired because you know more than the person you&rsquo;re working for.<br/><br/>This doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re stupid, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re better. It just means you&rsquo;re a specialist. You spend each day sharpening the skills your client needs, and they aren&rsquo;t just paying you to make something. They&rsquo;re paying you to help them learn about what you do, and why you do it, so you can make better things together.<br/><br/>Next time you&rsquo;re with a client, have a think about what you could do to help share your knowledge.[3. Dear My Clients - this doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll start pontificating or wearing a mortar board. Love, Oli]
