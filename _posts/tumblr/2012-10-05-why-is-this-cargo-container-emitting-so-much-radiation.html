<p>From Wired, a simply great piece of writing about a mysterious radioactive container:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Halfway down the second row, a crimson 20-footer with “TGHU 307703 0 22G1″ emblazoned in white on its side jerked the dials. As he passed a few feet from the box’s left side, Montagna was absorbing radiation equivalent to six chest x-rays per minute.</blockquote>
