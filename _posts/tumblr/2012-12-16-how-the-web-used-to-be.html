<a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">How the web used to be...</a><br/><p>I really love this article by Anil Dash. It manages to elucidate what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how much the web has changed in such a short space of time. Well worth a read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But they haven’t shown the web itself the respect and care it deserves, as a medium which has enabled them to succeed. And they’ve now narrowed the possibilites of the web for an entire generation of users who don’t realize how much more innovative and meaningful their experience could be.</p>
