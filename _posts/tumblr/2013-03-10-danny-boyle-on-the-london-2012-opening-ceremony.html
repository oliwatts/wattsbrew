<blockquote>Which is why, despite the excesses of the IOC and the 2012 corporate sponsors, he retained his faith in the Olympic ideal, still believing that it’s “a healing and good thing for our kind, our species, for all of us. It brings people together.” He later dismisses pessimistic talk of white elephants, predicting that the Olympic Park will be a cherished part of east London in 20 years’ time, describing a place where friends and families will “come to spend the day”, shopping, going to the cinema, “cycling, picnicking, seeing a show in the stadium in the evening. It will work.”</blockquote>

<p>He did amazing things with that ceremony. Setting a tone that I think everyone really needed to get the most from Olympics. I miss it.</p>
