<p>Prompted by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jamesecalnan">James Calnan</a>&rsquo;s toot about questions for Abellio (the folks due to take over running the line between Colchester and London). I&rsquo;ve assembled a listy:<br/><br/></p><ol><li>Will you promise to keep the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nxeastanglia">@nxeastanglia</a> account alive, as it offers a bloody good service?</li>	<li>What&rsquo;s the plan for increasing the number of direct trains between Colchester and London between 0630 and 0730?</li>	<li>The seats on everything other than the crazily old Class 90 rolling stock are back breaking. Any plans to introduce trains with proper seating?</li>	<li>Season Direct is an antediluvian dinosaur of a system for regular commuters - any plans for something more modern?</li>	<li>If they win the full franchise, how will Crossrail services thru Shenfield affect them?</li>	<li>Any plans to extend Oyster beyond Romford?</li></ol>
