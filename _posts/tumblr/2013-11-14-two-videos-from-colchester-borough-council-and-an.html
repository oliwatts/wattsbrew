<p>There’s been some discussion today about a couple of videos produced by Colchester Borough Council: one about Food Waste Recycling, the other about ‘social media’. Given that I create online content for a living I thought i’d offer some constructive criticism, along with an offer of support to Colchester Borough Council <a href="#fn:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. </p>

<p>The two videos:</p>

<p>First, things first, I think the fact that these exist at all is a good thing. It means CBC have crossed from talking to doing, and that is a scary step. It’s also really important to say that I wouldn’t have approved either of these videos for release to the public, for one important reason.</p>

<p>I don’t understand what they’re trying to get me to do.</p>

<p>Video is an excellent online medium, and it is seductively easy to feel like you’re doing something good with it when perhaps you’re not. <em>Any</em> content you create needs to answer a really simple question: “What’s the story I’m trying to tell, and what do I want people to do once I’ve told them it?”</p>

<p>The ‘Binlings’ video is a great idea on paper, but I know from bitter experience how expensive and time consuming it is to create something that involves good character animation and which feels warm and fuzzy.</p>

<p>I think an alternative might have been to show the real impact of not recycling our food, and what happens when we recycle it: think piles and piles of landfill contrasted with neatly rotting compost or biogas.</p>

<p>My real beef is with the ‘Social Media video’. This is perpetuates so many myths about the modern internet which are just false. Social media is not:</p>

<ul><li>The future. It is the present.</li>
<li>Cost effective or cheap. Done properly it is expensive and can be inefficient. Done properly it will also transform what you do.</li>
<li>About young people. The fastest growing age groups on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ are those aged 45+ <a href="#fn:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[0]</a></li>
<li>New. Is what we’ve been doing for years (talking to people) its just using a new channel (the internet).</li>
</ul><p>A social media strategy is not ‘post 3 times a day to Twitter’. It is thinking deeply about how you will use these immensely powerful tools to have a proper connection with the people you serve — in this case everyone in Colchester.</p>

<p>So, my offer of help: I’ll gladly donate some time to help CBC write a <em>proper</em> social media strategy, and to understand what it could actually do for them. Anyone else in?</p>

<p><a href="#fn:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> This isn’t the first time I’ve offered. Back in March myself and some other interested folks met up with the council, but sadly nothing progressed. I’d love to do more. <a href="https://twitter.com/ColchChronic/status/310012191849992192">https://twitter.com/ColchChronic/status/310012191849992192</a></p>
