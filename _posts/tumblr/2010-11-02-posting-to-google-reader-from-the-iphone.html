<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started making use of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8">Reeder</a> for the iPhone and iPad. Its a great app for using Google Reader to sync items across the desktop, with one major flaw &ndash; a simple method of subscribing to feeds.</p><p>At present I can follow a bookmarklet which uses Javascript to discover the URL of the RSS document, and sends that address to Google Reader&rsquo;s &lsquo;add-new-feed&rsquo; URL. This works brilliantly on the desktop, but doesn&rsquo;t degrade nicely for mobile. It uses full sized and custom UI controls which are a pain on a smaller screen device. There is a mobile friendly feed subscription page available, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be accessible by Javascript.</p><p>More annoyingly, this bookmarklet is accessible outside of Reeder&rsquo;s build in web-browser, meaning even using the jerry-rigged method above doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Solving this problem within MobileSafari is obviously an Apple issue, but a potential fix for Reeder would be to add a function which pastes a feed URL into <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/m/directory?hl=en">Google Reader&rsquo;s mobile subscription page</a> from within the app. It would be a hack, but would be a very useful feature.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
