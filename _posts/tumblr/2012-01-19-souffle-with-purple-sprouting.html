<p>This is an adaptation from the utterly wonderfully brilliant &lsquo;River Cottage Veg Every Day&rsquo; by the long haired roustabout that is Hugh Hyphonated-Whitebread.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a rather lovely and comforting dish which is fiddley enough to feel like you&rsquo;ve accomplished something after you&rsquo;ve cooked it.<br/><br/>For two moderately hungry folk you will need:</p><ul><li>150g of Purple Sprouting Broccoli</li>	<li>&frac12; Onion, a bay leaf and some peppercorns</li>	<li>25g of butter and 25g of flour</li>	<li>150ml of milk</li>	<li>4 eggs, separated nicely</li>	<li>150g of grated, strong cheese (I used Stilton and Cheddar)</li>	<li>Nutmeg</li>	<li>125g of penne pasta (that&rsquo;s the spirally stuff)</li>	<li>Baking dish (one you might use for making lasagna or similar for two people)</li>	<li>Heavy baking tray which the baking dish can sit on</li>	<li>Electric mixer</li></ul>Preheat the oven to 190c and put a large heavy baking tray inside. Give your baking dish a good butter as well.<br/><br/><strong>Step One: Broccoli and Pasta</strong><br/><br/>Finely chop the purple sprouting and pop it in a pan, just covered by some water. Whilst you&rsquo;re doing this put the pasta in a separate pan and also cover it with boiling water. You want to cook the pasta and broccoli for about 8 minutes.<br/><br/>While they&rsquo;re cooking add the milk, peppercorns, bay leaf and (unchopped) onion to a pan. Gently heat the milk so the flavours infuse. This will smell gorgeous.<br/><br/>When the pasta is done, drain it and toss it in some olive oil. The broccoli should be done too, so give that a drain and spread it out on a chopping board so it cools and doesn&rsquo;t continue to cook.<br/><br/><strong>Step Two: Sauce!</strong><br/><br/>Put the butter in a pan and gentle melt it. Add the flour and combine together until you have a roux. Cook the roux for a couple of minutes, then add the milk to the pan in small batches, beating hard until it&rsquo;s mixed in well. The sauce you end up with should be very thick.<br/><br/>Add in the cheese, nutmeg and egg yolks with a darn good stir. Then stir in the broccoli and pasta.<br/><br/><strong>Step Three: Stiffening your whites</strong><br/><br/>Put your egg whites into a mixing bowl and mix up to the hard peak stage [1. For the uninitiated this means that the foam you&rsquo;ve formed stands proud and doesn&rsquo;t sink back when you take the mixer or whisk out.]<br/><br/><strong>Step Four: Assembly</strong><br/><br/>Stir in one spoonful of your stiff egg mixture to the rest of the ingredients, then carefully fold [2. The best way to do this is to add the egg whites in two batches, lifting the rest of the mixture over them in the pan. The aim is <strong>not</strong> to knock the air out of the mixture. You&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve done it right if you can tap the side of the pan with a wooden spoon and it sounds hollow.] the rest in.<br/><br/>Spoon the mixture into your buttered dish and put into the oven on the hot baking tray [3. This helps the dish cook evenly, as the heat from the tray radiates through the base of the dish.]. Cook for about 25 mins or until the top goes nice and brown.<br/><br/>[gallery link=&ldquo;file&rdquo;]
