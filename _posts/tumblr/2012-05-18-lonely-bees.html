For about three weeks each spring there are clouds of them, all buzzing around frantically looking for somewhere to nest (usually the lawn and borders). I used to think there was just one species but, in the hours spent patiently watching and photographing them last week, I noted at least three types. Or was it four? I&rsquo;ve no idea</blockquote><br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve noticed the same thing in our garden whilst beginning the planting out of veg and the tending of borders.<br/><br/>They&rsquo;re fascinating creatures, Solitary Bees. The ones in our garden search for a patch of fresh earth to burrow into and lay their eggs â€” a great sign of a healthy local eco-system, and also pretty cool. They&rsquo;re the Johnny Cash of the Insectae world.
