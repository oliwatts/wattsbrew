<p>Great post from ArsTechnica about putting a monetary value to your activity on sites like Facebook and Google:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>Privacyfix measures your last 60 days of activity on Google, extrapolates that to a year, and uses a value-per-search estimate. Analysts believed Google was making $14.70 per 1,000 searches in 2010, and possibly less in 2011. Of course, if you spend all your time searching for luxury hotels or mesothelioma lawyers—and then clicking through the advertised links—you’re much more valuable than the average user.</blockquote>
