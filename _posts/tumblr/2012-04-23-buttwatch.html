<p>In response to overwhelming demand [1. Read: A few, relentless, questions at work] here is the first post about my Butts.<br/><br/>Bought in an attempt to stave off the hosepipe ban [2. Which was announced the day after we finished the laborious task of making our raised beds] these two puppies can hold a bulging 400L of cool, Essex run-off.<br/><br/>I managed to install them two weekends ago, and as you can see from the photos, they&rsquo;re swollen with sky juice.<br/><br/>I had to fashion a makeshift down-pipe made of 34mm waste pipe which is connected to the gutter with a liberal splurging of solvent cement. This beastly thing creates a chemical reaction between the two types of PVC which makes them liquid. When they solidify they&rsquo;re welded together.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s missing is some form of proper overflow device, but I quite like the dangly drip hose option in the third photo&hellip;<br/><br/>I promise to keep you updated on the status of my Butts throughout the year.<br/><br/>[gallery]<br/><br/><strong>Update #1 — 28th May</strong>The butts are nearly depleted. Three weeks of almost no rain have meant I&rsquo;ve drained them dry and they&rsquo;re just aching for a top up.<br/><br/>Internal butt photos below:<br/><br/><img src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/20120528-200859.jpg" alt="20120528-200859.jpg" class="alignnone size-full"/><br/><img src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/20120528-200910.jpg" alt="20120528-200910.jpg" class="alignnone size-full"/><strong>Update #2 — 10th June</strong><br/><br/>Full. Unpleasantly so. Like after a lovely roast dinner following a long walk.<br/><br/>Raining again now. Might have to release the pressure. <br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/20120610-191701.jpg"><img src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/20120610-191701.jpg" alt="20120610-191701.jpg" class="alignnone size-full"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/20120610-191707.jpg"><img src="http://obilog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/20120610-191707.jpg" alt="20120610-191707.jpg" class="alignnone size-full"/></a></p>
