<p>I read each of these today. Each made me misty eyed, and grateful for what I have. Amazing writing.

<a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2011/11/three">Three, by Stephen Hackett</a>
</p><blockquote>Today, you’re three years old. It really seems like just yesterday you were born. Your mom and I were so nervous about being parents, that when we brought you home from the hospital, we didn’t take you out of the carseat immediately. Instead, we just looked at you, wondering how we could unstrap you without hurting your little chicken arms.</blockquote>
And the follow up. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2014/11/six">Six, also by Stephen Hackett:</a>
<blockquote>That picture — of my six-year old son singing to my newborn — is everything you need to know about Josiah. The universe has been unbelievably cruel to him with a rare, aggressive cancer diagnosis, but his life is full of love and hope and music.

<blockquote>“Maybe it’s just not supposed to happen for us.”
My wife Erin — the most important person in my world — is feeling somber again.
It’s late 2011. We’ve been trying to have a child for a year now. It hasn’t happened yet.</blockquote>
