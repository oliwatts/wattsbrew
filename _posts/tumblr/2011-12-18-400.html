<p>I have a short, true story to tell.<br/><br/>When I was 14 I moved schools because I was being very badly bullied - it almost destroyed me as a person. I went to a wonderful school in Colchester and made friends. I realised that what I had been through wasn&rsquo;t unique, and I wanted to help other people.<br/><br/>By the time I turned 16 I knew how to help. I wrote a web page which talked about my experiences and encouraged other people to share theirs. The page was picked up by the local press, then the national press, then the international press.<br/><br/>After three years my home made single web page <a href="http://www.pupiline.net">had become an online community called Pupiline</a> used by 3,000,000 young people from across the world. Thousands logged on daily to post in forums (retro!) to support each other through some horrendous circumstances.<br/><br/>There is nothing quite like knowing that there are 5 people alive today because of that support.<br/><br/>Why am I sharing this story?<br/><br/>Facebook announced last week that they are introducing a live link with Lifeline, a US organisation that offers online counselling to vulnerable people.<br/><br/>The story was covered in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2011/12/13/facebook-empowers-friends-to-prevent-suicide/">Forbes</a> by Larry Magid. I met Larry whilst he covered the development of Pupiline when I visited Washington DC in 2001.<br/><br/>Quoting Larry:</p><blockquote>The bottom line is that friends need to help friends. And being a friend today means using any means available – including social media — to support each other.</blockquote>I totally agree.
