<a href="http://the-magazine.org/5/letterdepressed">How to not suck at Letterpress</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>Loren Brichter’s Letterpress is a beautifully designed iOS game that mixes Scrabble with the ancient Japanese strategy game Go. It’s the best casual game I’ve played in years, and it’s wasted more of my time than I’ll admit.</p>
  
  <p>The trouble is, as the executive editor of this publication can attest, figuring out an ideal strategy isn’t obvious. A lot of otherwise brilliant players seem to struggle at Letterpress.</p>

<p>I heart <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8">Letterpress</a>, but I am terrible at it — I approach it like Scrabble or Boggle. This article is rather helpful.</p>
